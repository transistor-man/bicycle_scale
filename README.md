# Custom bike repair stand with integrated scale
Arduino code for a custom bicycle scale

Do you have a bike with the dubious derailleur that just needs some twiddling? Always wanted something to prop it up while you work on it? Did you know wall mounted bike repair arms mysteriously became cheap? This project uses a wall mounted bike repair arm, attaches it to a moible base and adds in an integrated scale to display bike mass.
